This is a repo to store the R script that produced the results and graphics in the Football Outsiders article ["Offensive Personnel vs. Men in the Box: A Football Causality Tutorial."](https://www.footballoutsiders.com/stat-analysis/2019/offensive-personnel-men-box)

Unfortunately the data underlying the analysis is proprietary, but you should be able to use this code with minor modifications to produce similar results using the NFL's [Big Data Bowl data.](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nfl-big-data-bowl-2020)
